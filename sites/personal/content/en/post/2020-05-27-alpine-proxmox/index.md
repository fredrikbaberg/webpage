Since I donÂ´t reinstall Alpine Linux in Proxmox that often, I sometimes loose track of the command to make it appear correctly with qemu guest agent. These are the steps I use:

* Enable qemu agent in Proxmox
* run `rc-update add local default`
* In Alpine linux, create a file called `/etc/local.d/Qemu.start` with content:
* > #!/bin/sh
* > qemu-ga -d -p /dev/vport1p1
* Make file executable
* Install qemu guest agent:
* > `apk add qemu-guest-agent`
